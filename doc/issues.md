### Issues
- [x] **Making an anonymous reservation with existing email gives a session cookie for existing acount!**
- [x] **Session cookie remains valid after logout**
    - [x] Backend
    - [x] Frontend
- [ ] **Reject any empty request**
- [ ] **Error handling for frontend API**
- [x] ID is used as password, but cannot handle non-unique password
- [x] Cannot create a custom password
- [x] Difference between ID and Key?
- [ ] Database culling trigger?
    - [ ] Clients by Epoch accessed:
    - [ ] Delete clients whose last accessed is over 2 years (configurable)
- [x] Reservation Test has lots of disabled tests
- [ ] ID sometimes contains an unhashed password

- [x] Make variables configurable
    - [x] Password length
    - [x] Username length
    - [x] Time to keep temp account
    - [x] Time to keep reservation
        - [x] Tentative
        - [x] Past start
- [x] Password length not checked on changed password
- [ ] Slow requests issue (Hash algorythm?)
- [ ] **Cookie security parameters**
    - [ ] `Secure` cookie parameter
    - [ ] others [Cookie security](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#cookies)
- [ ] **Maximum number of sessions limit**
- [ ] **input validation**
    - [ ] Dates
    - [ ] Times
    - [ ] Reservation sizes
- [ ] **Session keys in searchable clientsBySession map are unhashed**
- [ ] Session key handling requires a redesign to incorporate fingerprint, hashing and performant searching
- [ ] Light weight event list should probably be cached and not re-created for each request
    - map out everything the list events do
